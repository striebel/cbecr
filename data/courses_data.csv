51,133,Introduction to Mathematical Thinking,"learn how to think the way mathematicians do a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system school math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself the key to success in school math is to learn to think inside the box in contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside the box a valuable ability in today s world this course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking week start with the lecture it explains what this course is about it comes with a short background reading assignment, to read before you start the course, and a reading supplement on set theory for use later in the course, both in downloadable pdf format this initial orientation lecture is important, since this course is probably not like any math course you have taken before even if in places it might look like one after that, lecture prepares the groundwork for the course then in lecture we dive into the first topic this may all look like easy stuff, but tens of thousands of former students found they had trouble later by skipping through week too quickly be warned if possible, form or join a study group and discuss everything with them by the way, the time estimates for watching the video lectures are machine generated, based on the video length expect to spend a lot longer going through the lectures sufficiently well to understand the material the time estimates for

governments, private business and ordinary citizens and in many parts of the world, it has been one of the most important threats to peace, security and stability but what does this exactly mean what is the nature of this threat who or what is threatened, how, by whom and why what can be done about it or how can we at least limit the impact of terrorism and make sure that terrorists do not make headlines and manage to scare us these are just a handful of questions that will be addressed in this course that consists of three parts first it focuses on the essence of terrorism as an instrument to achieve certain goals, in addition to an exploration of this phenomenon and the difficulties in defining it the second part provides an overview of the state of the art in counter terrorism studies since / terrorism studies have grown exponentially, reflecting the rise in perceived threats but what has academia come up with what theories, assumptions and conventional wisdom has it produced that could be of help in understanding terrorism and dealing with it the most interesting results are examined and compared with empirical evidence with the aim to either stress their importance or to debunk them as myths the final part looks into the implications and possibilities for policy making the course ends with a module specifically designed to address one of today s most topical issue the

77,160,Economics of Money and Banking,"the last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system the financial crisis of is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system produced and sponsored by the institute for new economic thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant three features of the new system are central most important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities the financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see the result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse second, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order third, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory that s the reason this course places dealers, in both capital markets and money markets, at the very center of the picture, as profit seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market based credit introduction the first two lectures paint a picture of the monetary system as the essential infrastructure of a decentralized market economy the second lecture, the natural hierarchy of money, is a kind of high level overview of the entire course, so don t expect to fully understand it until you look back after completing

system, in which every participant faces a daily settlement constraint a survival constraint from this point of view, the wholesale money market plays a key role by allowing banks to relax the discipline of a binding settlement constraint, delaying final payment by putting settlement off until a later date the relative importance of the various money markets has changed since the crisis fed

that social networking might hold for helping us to improve our health examining what already exists is the first step in the design thinking process as part of assessing what is , designers follow the customer home and explore the problems they are trying to solve in life versus their product use once they have thoroughly explored and looked for patterns, designers look toward the future and ask what if this is the creative part of the process, but it also requires a disciplined approach by the end of this module, you ll understand how to use design thinking to generate innovative ideas,

120,214,Model Thinking,"we live in a complex world with diverse people, firms, and governments whose behaviors aggregate to produce novel, unexpected phenomena we see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends how do we make sense of it models evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don t and, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one why do models make us better thinkers models help us to better organize information to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data choose your metaphor available on the internet models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts they help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies they even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures in this class, i present a starter kit of models i start with models of tipping points i move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians the models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses they also help you in life here s how the course will work for each model, i present a short, easily digestible overview lecture then, i ll dig deeper i ll go into the technical details of the model those technical lectures won t require calculus but be prepared for some algebra for all the lectures, i ll offer some questions and we ll have quizzes and even a final exam if you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you ll receive a course certificate if you just decide to follow along for the introductory lectures to gain some exposure that s fine too it s all free and it s all here to help make you a better thinker why model segregation/peer effects in these lectures, i describe some of the reasons why a person would want to take a modeling course these reasons fall into four broad categories to be an intelligent citizen of the world to be a clearer thinker to understand and use data to better decide, strategize, and design there are two readings for this section these should be read either after the first video or at the completion of all of the videos we now jump directly into some models we contrast two types of models that explain a single phenomenon, namely that people tend to live and interact with people who look, think, and act like themselves after an introductory lecture, we cover famous models by schelling and granovetter that cover these phenomena we follows those with a

explore the mysteries of aggregation, i e adding things up we start by considering how bers aggregate, focusing on the central limit theorem we then turn to adding up rules we consider the game of life and one dimensional cellular automata models both models show how simple rules can combine to produce interesting phenomena last, we consider aggregating preferences here we see how individual preferences can be rational, but the aggregates need not be there exist many great places on the web to read more about the central limit theorem, the binomial distribution, six sigma, the game of

144,238,Greek and Roman Mythology,"myths are traditional stories that have endured over a long time some of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding of a nation others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed what are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them this course will focus on the myths of ancient greece and rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations we will also pay some attention to the way the greeks and romans themselves understood their own myths are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it or are they just entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over this course will investigate these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature, religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death course schedule week introduction to greek and roman mythology this first week we ll introduce the class, paying attention to how the course itself works we ll also begin to think about the topic at hand myth how can we begin to define myth how does myth work what have ancient and modern theorists, philosophers, and other thinkers had to say about myth this week we ll also begin our foray into homer s world, with an eye to how we can best approach epic poetry readings no texts this week, but it would be a good idea to get started on next week s reading to get ahead of the game video lectures quiz complete the quiz by the end of the week week becoming a hero in week , we begin our intensive study of myth through homer s epic poem, the odyssey this core text not only gives us an exciting story to appreciate on its own merits but also offers us a kind of laboratory where we can investigate myth using different theoretical approaches this week we focus on the young telemachus tour as he begins to come of age we also accompany his father odysseus as he journeys homeward after the trojan war along the way, we ll examine questions of heroism, relationships between gods and mortals, family dynamics, and the homeric values of hospitality and resourcefulness readings homer, odyssey, books video lectures quiz complete the quiz by the end of the week week adventures out and back this week we ll follow the exciting peregrinations of odysseus, man of twists and turns, over sea and land the hero s journeys abroad and as he re enters his homeland are fraught with perils this portion of the odyssey features unforgettable monsters and exotic witches we also follow odysseus into the underworld, where he meets shades of comrades and relatives here we encounter some of the best known stories to survive from all of ancient myth readings homer, odyssey, books video lectures quiz complete the quiz by the end of the week week identity and signs as he makes his way closer and closer to re taking his place on ithaca and with his family, a disguised odysseus must use all his resources to regain his kingdom we ll see many examples of reunion as odysseus carefully begins to reveal his identity to various members of his household his servants, his dog, his son, and finally, his wife penelope while also scheming against those who have usurped his place readings homer, odyssey, books video lectures quiz complete the quiz by the end of the week week gods and humans we will take a close look at the most authoritative story on the origin of the cosmos from greek antiquity hesiod s theogony hesiod was generally considered the only poet who could rival homer the theogony, or birth of the gods, tells of an older order of gods, before zeus, who were driven by powerful passions and strange appetites this poem presents the beginning of the world as a time of fierce struggle and violence as the universe begins to take shape, and order, out of chaos readings hesiod, theogony the works and days is not required for the course video lectures quiz complete the quiz by the end of the week week ritual and religion this week s readings give us a chance to look closely at greek religion in its various guises myth, of course, forms one important aspect of religion, but so does ritual how ancient myths and rituals interact teaches us a lot about both of these powerful cultural forms we will read two of the greatest hymns to olympian deities that tell up close and personal stories about the gods while providing intricate descriptions of the rituals they like us humans to perform readings homeric hymn to apollo homeric hymn to demeter there are two hymns to each that survive, only the longer hymn to apollo and the longer hymn to demeter are required for the course video lectures quiz complete the quiz by the end of the week week justice what counts as a just action, and what counts as an unjust one who gets to decide these are trickier questions than some will have us think this unit looks at one of the most famously thorny issues of justice in all of the ancient world in aeschylus oresteia the only surviving example of tragedy in its original trilogy form we hear the story of agamemnon s return home after the trojan war unlike odysseus eventual joyful reunion with his wife and children, this hero is betrayed by those he considered closest to him this family s cycle of revenge, of which this story is but one episode, carries questions of justice and competing loyalties well beyond agamemnon s immediate family, eventually ending up on the athenian acropolis itself readings aeschylus, agamemnon aeschylus, eumenides video lectures quiz complete the quiz by the end of the week week unstable selves this week we encounter two famous tragedies, both set at thebes, that center on questions of guilt and identity sophocles oedipus rex and eurpides bacchae oedipus is confident that he can escape the unthinkable fate that was foretold by the delphic oracle we watch as he eventually realizes the horror of what he has done with odysseus, we saw how a great hero can re build his identity after struggles, while oedipus shows us how our identities can dissolve before our very eyes the myth of oedipus is one of transgressions intentional and unintentional and about the limits of human knowledge in euripides bacchae, the identity of gods and mortals is under scrutiny here, dionysus, the god of wine and of tragedy, and also madness, appears as a character on stage through the dissolution of pentheus, we see the terrible consequences that can occur when a god s divinity is not properly acknowledged readings sophocles, oedipus rex euripides, bacchae video lectures quiz complete the quiz by the end of the week week the roman hero, remade moving ahead several centuries, we jump into a different part of the mediterranean to let the romans give us their take on myth although many poets tried to rewrite homer for their own times, no one succeeded quite like vergil his epic poem, the aeneid, chronicles a powerful re building of a culture that both identifies with and defines itself against previously told myths in contrast to the scarcity of information about homer, we know a great deal about vergil s life and historical context, allowing us insight into myth making in action readings vergil, aeneid, books video lectures quiz complete the quiz by the end of the week week roman myth and ovid s metamorphoses our consideration of vergil s tale closes with his trip to the underworld in book next, we turn to a more playful roman poet, ovid, whose genius is apparent in nearly every kind of register profound, witty, and satiric all at once, ovid s powerful re tellings of many ancient myths became the versions that are most familiar to us today finally, through the lens of the romans and others who remythologize, we wrap up the course with a retrospective look at myth readings vergil, aeneid, book ovid, metamorphoses, books , , and video lectures quiz complete the quiz by the end of the week readings there are no

149,243,Process Mining Data science in Action,"process mining is the missing link between model based process analysis and data oriented analysis techniques through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains data science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use big data in a smart way will not survive it is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis the data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis process mining bridges the gap between traditional model based process analysis e g , simulation and other business process management techniques and data centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining process mining seeks the confrontation between event data i e , observed behavior and process models hand made or discovered automatically this technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes organizations and systems example applications include analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an x ray machine all of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models hence, we refer to this as data science in action the course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining participants will learn various process discovery algorithms these can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented moreover, the course will provide easy to use software, real life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains this course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process re design then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling the course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments the course covers the three main types of process mining the first type of process mining is discovery a discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a priori information an example is the alpha algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model a petri net explaining the behavior recorded in the log the second type of process mining is conformance here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa the third type of process mining is enhancement here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a priori model an example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e g , showing bottlenecks process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting the latter is known as operational support an example is the detection of non conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place another example is time prediction for running cases, i e , given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases process mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management it also helps to address the classical divide between business and it evidence based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development the course uses many examples using real life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms after taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the business process intelligence field after taking this course you should have a good understanding of business process intelligence techniques in particular process mining , understand the role of big data in today s society, be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and verification, be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log both manually and using tools , be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models both manually and using tools , be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log e g , show bottlenecks , have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project, be able to

172,268,Understanding Einstein The Special Theory of Relativity,"in this course we will seek to understand einstein, especially focusing on the special theory of relativity that albert einstein, as a twenty six year old patent clerk, introduced in his miracle year of our goal will be to go behind the myth making and beyond the popularized presentations of relativity in order to gain a deeper understanding of both einstein the person and the concepts, predictions, and strange paradoxes of his theory some of the questions we will address include how did einstein come up with his ideas what was the nature of his genius what is the meaning of relativity what s special about the special theory of relativity why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival what does it mean to say that time is the fourth dimension can time actually run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity is time travel possible, and if so, how why can t things travel faster than the speed of light is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime is there any evidence that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation why didn t einstein win the nobel prize for the theory of relativity about the instructor dr larry lagerstrom is the director of academic programs at stanford university s center for professional development, which offers graduate certificates in subjects such as artificial intelligence, cyber security, data mining, nanotechnology, innovation, and management science he holds degrees in physics, mathematics, and the history of science, has published a book and a ted ed video on young einstein from the doxerl affair to the miracle year, and has had over , students worldwide

181,277,Mathematics for Machine Learning Multivariate Calculus,"this course offers a brief introduction to the multivariate calculus required to build many common machine learning techniques we start at the very beginning with a refresher on the rise over run formulation of a slope, before converting this to the formal definition of the gradient of a function we then start to build up a set of tools for making calculus easier and faster next, we learn how to calculate vectors that point up hill on multidimensional surfaces and even put this into action using an interactive game we take a look at how we can use calculus to build approximations to functions, as well as helping us to quantify how accurate we should expect those approximations to be we also spend some time talking about where calculus comes up in the training of neural networks, before finally showing you how it is applied in linear regression models this course is intended to offer an intuitive understanding of calculus, as well as the language necessary to look concepts up yourselves when you get stuck hopefully, without going into too much detail, you ll still come away with the confidence to dive into some more focused machine learning courses in future what is calculus understanding calculus is central to understanding machine learning you can think of calculus as simply a set of tools for analysing the relationship between functions and their inputs often, in machine learning, we are trying to find the inputs which enable a function to best match the data we start this module from the basics, by recalling what a function is and where we might encounter one following this, we talk about the how, when sketching a function on a graph, the slope describes the rate of change of the output with respect to an input using this visual intuition we next derive a robust mathematical definition of a derivative, which we then use to differentiate some interesting functions finally, by studying a few examples, we develop four handy time saving rules that enable us to speed up differentiation for many common scenarios hours to complete hours to complete reading videos total min ,

190,287,"Leading for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion in Higher Education","this course is open to professionals interested in learning more about leadership in higher education for a changing demographic or interested in developing their own leadership skills the very idea that individuals can be taught to lead is not without its skeptics reasonable people, even some scholars in the field, point to the important traits, skills, and attributes that are observed in many visible leaders and contend that certain qualities necessary for effective leadership are not easily transmitted to accept this premise and conclude that some people are born as natural leaders and others cannot be expected to lead at all is to make a mistake at the other end of the logical spectrum we believe that leadership can be taught as long as it is concurrently nurtured, that most people possess a constellation of strengths around which they can construct their own leadership philosophy and approach, and that leadership development programming if done well can be transformative for organizers and participants course level objectives understand the historical narrative of institutions as well as institutional structures that have created instances of inclusion and exclusion in colleges and universities describe how transformational leadership is enacted for diversity, equity, and inclusion in

discrete and continuous random variables subsequently the cumulative probability distribution is introduced and its properties and usage are explained as well in a next lecture it is shown how a random variable with its associated probability distribution can be characterized by statistics like a mean and variance, just like observational data the effects of changing random variables by multiplication or addition on these statistics are explained as well the lecture thereafter introduces the normal distribution, starting by explaining its functional form and some general properties next, the basic usage of the normal distribution to calculate probabilities is explained and in a final lecture the binomial distribution, an important probability distribution for discrete data, is introduced and further explained by the end of this module you have covered quite some ground and have a solid basis to answer the most frequently encountered statistical questions importantly, the

with human liberty and economic aspirations this course considers these issues and provides a tour though existing legal regimes governing pollution, water law, endangered species, toxic substances, environmental impact analyses, and environmental risk note the environmental law policy course will close for new learner enrollment on february , learners who have already enrolled will continue to see it on their coursera dashboard as long as they remain enrolled in the course if you are currently enrolled in this course, please see the announcement sent on february , , for additional details common law approaches to environmental problems as the course does not presume any previous knowledge of the law or legal experience, it begins by teaching students how to read cases, to learn from judicial opinions in real life disputes how judges articulate and apply legal principles we focus on the law of nuisance, starting with cases involving simple disputes between neighbors, and then move to cases involving air and water pollution and even a very recent case on the introduction of exotic species into a river system we end the week, as we ll end every week, with a session spent on legal

the way in which property law recognizes these values after using two cases involving property rights to water to introduce ourselves to property law, we ll use the american constitutional approach to takings of property to determine when governments are forced to pay property holders when environmental requirements infringe too much on private property rights these cases are at the crux of an evolving philosophical dispute between whether we look at land merely as a personal commodity or as part of larger ecosystems that, often, demand recognition and require changes in personal behavior in our theory session, we ll introduce ourselves to a very powerful and famous economic model, the tragedy of the commons model, that explains why markets often cannot adequately protect commonly held resources such as the oceans and atmosphere, and how legal regimes may be needed to correct the problem we also post this week a peer review essay exercise, which is mandatory for students wishing to

of harm amplify the power of environmental law we then analyze the role risk played in an ongoing dispute between the united states and canada on the one hand and the european community on the other over synthetic growth hormones given to cattle in north america we shift to considerations of risk in the clean up of sites contaminated with hazardous substances under a famous american statute, the so called superfund statute in our theory session, we look at two economic dimensions of risk that explain why people rationally concern themselves with worst case possibilities and also concern

which you ll get chance to practice and analyze mindfulness on yourself in the end, the course aims to provide a responsible, comprehensive, and inclusive education about and in mindfulness as a contemporary phenomenon during the production of this course, we have been supported by willem kuyken, director of the university of oxford mindfulness centre, and stephen batchelor, co founder of bodhi college and we gratefully acknowledge the contributions made by mark williams, co developer of mindfulness based cognitive therapy mbct , and rebecca crane, director of the centre for mindfulness research and practice at the university of bangor we have recently added expert advice from dawn scott spirit rock barre centre for buddhist studies , sydney spears university of kansa , elisabeth stanley georgetown university , susan woods centre for mindfulness studies , patricia rockman university of toronto and jeff corntassel university of victoria a deep and profound dive into the ethical, social, psychological, and philosophical implications of modern day mindfulness practice the course is not for the faint of heart, perhaps, but it is also full of practical, guided exercises for the uninitiated thank you for redefining my relationship to mindfulness in a completely new and thought provoking way april the course enabled me to explore the mindfulness construct at its deeper lever from philosophical, psychological and political lenses the mindfulness labs were very useful in practicing the skills of being mindful nov i took this course after a period of time when i was trying to practice mindfulness and meditation, but with doubtful success the course answered many questions to me, and i needed that to keep me motivated it really helped me understand the origins and, more importantly, benefits of mindfulness practice and made me persist in my attempts i m really glad i took the course, i find it interesting, well taught and very useful for all those seeking deeper explanation in why trying mindfulness oct i have taken other courses in other online platforms however, this has been one of the best courses i have found online oct i really like the invitation to us, the learners, to rethink our preconceptions and beliefs, and then make our own judgement about mindfulness the overall tone was very friendly and open, resources very useful dec to the course people come to the study of mindfulness for all kinds of reasons i m curious to know what brings you here perhaps you re someone who already has a mindfulness practice and you re keen to know more about it perhaps you re someone who has heard a lot about this mysterious thing called mindfulness, but you re suspicious or skeptical about it, so you want to see what all the fuss is about is it really something real just a fad or fashion does it really cure all our ills perhaps you re a student of psychology, or philosophy, or politics, or you re an entrepreneur or a therapist whoever you are, and whyever you re here, you re very welcome i look forward to learning about and from you as we embark on this adventure together de mystifying mindfulness was first launched in and, since that time, it has been honoured by the participation of about , people on coursera during these years, we have listened carefully to the views, feedback, and needs of the participants, which have prompted us to make a series of changes and additions to the course thanks to the generosity of our donors through our voluntary dana box , we had the resources we needed to make the additions so, as well as some minor changes, we ve launched major rounds of updates, including adding extra materials about sitting with difficulties and about the challenges of teaching mindfulness in we also added some extra audio files with meditation guidance for participants who requested these in the voice of chris goto jones then, in , we added two entire new modules mindfulness, trauma social justice mindfulness, nature and the land , both of which included additional video and audio sessions this update also included a new group of interviews with leading figures in the fields of the practice and study of mindfulness the result of these updates, we hope, is a responsive and relatively comprehensive guide to de mystifying mindfulness a side effect might be that the style of presentation might sometimes seem a little inconsistent we hope that isn t too disconcerting for you good luck with the course, and best wishes for your new adventure hours to complete hours to complete reading videos

first module, we re going to explore the foundational question of what mindfulness actually is this module has been designed to approach this question by considering a series of preconceptions about mindfulness in contemporary societies hence, here we meet the characters who will help and guide us through the rest of the course the scientist, the monk, the ninja, the zombie, and the hippie i hope you find these to be worthwhile companions on our journey in the end, we ll discover that these preconceptions are not without merit, but that they are only partial pictures of the whole we ll also engage in our first meditation lab so that we can begin to weigh these preconceptions against our own experiences begin working on the week s meditation lab exercises at the beginning of each week be

to the idea of mindfulness when we make it into something that can be measured, and then we ll investigate some of the most popular and effective mindfulness based interventions, such as mbsr and mbct

266,364,Smart Cities Management of Smart Urban Infrastructures,"learn about smart cities within the context of management of urban infrastructures the introduction of smart urban technologies into legacy infrastructures has resulted in erous challenges and opportunities for contemporary cities and will continue to do so this course will help you to understand how to make the best of these smart technologies in your cities legacy infrastructures over the past few years, advances in the information and communication technologies icts have significantly challenged the traditionally stable land scape of urban infrastructure service provision this has resulted in increasing interest from both technology vendors and public authorities in the transition of cities towards so called smart cities although such smart technologies can provide immense opportunities for citizens and service providers alike, the icts often act as disruptive innovators of urban infrastructure service provision in this mooc, you will gain a thorough understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the smart urban infrastructures, namely smart urban transportation and smart urban energy systems over the journey of this week online course you will learn about the most important principles for the management of smart urban infrastructures as well as the applications of these principles in the transportation and energy sectors this course does not have any prerequisites however, to take the most away from of this mooc, we strongly encourage you to enroll in our other mooc on the management of urban infrastructures, which has been widely praised by learners through this course, you will gain a deep understanding of the nature of disruptive innovations smart technologies in urban infrastructure systems learn about state of the art strategies for effectively managing the transition from legacy infrastructures to smart urban systems study the management of the transition phase

268,366,Introduction to Economic Theories,"wondering why economists have not predicted serious financial crises shocked by economic assumptions of human behavior as self centered and focusing only on what can be measured asking yourself if there are no sensible economic alternatives to free markets then you are at the right place to learn economics this is the first online course that teaches economics from a pluralist perspective economic pluralism means that a plurality of theoretical and methodological viewpoints is regarded as valuable in itself and is simply the best way in which economics can make progress in understanding the world this mooc will illustrate economic pluralism not only in substance but also in form you will see not only me, a professor of economics, but also a pop up prof of our business school, who illustrates the actor perspective of firms, government and civil society and you will meet an online student, based in greece, who will help you through the tutorial videos in which i will explain key concepts, tools and techniques i will not limit myself to the dominant theory, as almost every other course does instead, i will introduce you to four very different economic theories for the whole set of standard topics in microeconomics and macroeconomics the theories are presented every time from broad and more interdisciplinary to narrow and more mathematical the four theories that i like to introduce you to are social economics, institutional economics, post keynesian economics and, at the very end of each topic, neoclassical economics, for the special case of ideally functioning markets but not everything is different in this course like every economics course, it includes bers, diagrams, tables, equations, and some calculations why would you go through the effort of learning the basics of four theories instead of one because it will help you to see why many economists cannot predict crises, whereas others can see signals but are often not being listened to because they do not belong to the dominant school of thought it will also enable you to see that it is just one theory claiming economic agents to be self centered and focusing on the measurable only other economic theories go well beyond these limitations and, finally, the pluralist approach will provide you with policy alternatives to neoliberalist policies promoting free markets the objective of this course is twofold first, to enable you to understand different economic viewpoints, linked to important traditions in economic thought, and basic economic concepts belonging to these theoretical perspectives second, to enable you to do some basic economic calculations that are important in economic life, such as calculating an inflation rate, and in economic policies, such as estimating the rough gains from trade for both trading partners, and in economic arguments, such as in calculating utility maximization with given prices and budgets please

269,367,Probabilistic Graphical Models Representation,"probabilistic graphical models pgms are a rich framework for encoding probability distributions over complex domains joint multivariate distributions over large bers of random variables that interact with each other these representations sit at the intersection of statistics and computer science, relying on concepts from probability theory, graph algorithms, machine learning, and more they are the basis for the state of the art methods in a wide variety of applications, such as medical diagnosis, image understanding, speech recognition, natural language processing, and many, many more they are also a foundational tool in formulating many machine learning problems this course is the first in a sequence of three it describes the two basic pgm representations bayesian networks, which rely on a directed graph and markov networks, which use an undirected graph the course discusses both the theoretical properties of these representations as well as their use in practice the highly recommended honors track contains several hands on assignments on how to represent some real world problems the course also presents some important extensions beyond the basic pgm representation, which allow more complex models to be encoded compactly week week hours to complete hour to complete introduction and overview this

surprisingly rich ber of factors at many different levels of organization you will see that development can be studied in various domains and at various levels of understanding, from different angles and disciplines importantly, you will come to understand that processes within and between the various domains and levels of organization continuously interact to shape development this implies that understanding development requires taking an interdisciplinary approach in order to help you organize your thinking about this complexity you will learn more about the developmental systems approach and theories related to that we will look, amongst other things, at the brain and motor development, cognitive, language and social emotional development and all the factors that have an influence on development to illustrate how an interdisciplinary approach helps to understand child development you will see how researchers from various disciplines and backgrounds study child development at

requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity knowledge is where this course comes in no matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing we will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it we will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process once recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing it allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music the contemporary editing tool is the digital audio workstation daw , a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project we will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all daws provide after editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board a very creative place if you know how to use it we will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes the mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music we will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context in the end, the music production process relies on your creativity creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world if you have an idea in your head, it will take erous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience you bring the dedication and creativity, and this course will bring you the knowledge to make that happen week week hours to

308,409,"Anatomy of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis","warning these videos contai n images of human dissection may be disturbing to some human structure is important to all of us as it has been for millennia artists, teachers, health care providers, scientists and most children try to understand the human form from stick figure drawings to electron microscopy learning the form of people is of great interest to us physicians, nurses, physician assistants, emergency medical services personnel and many, many others learning anatomy classically involved dissection of the deceased whether directly in the laboratory or from texts, drawings, photographs or videos there are many wonderful resources for the study of anatomy developing an understanding of the human form requires significant work and a wide range of resources in this course, we have attempted to present succinct videos of human anatomy some will find these images to be disturbing and these images carry a need to respect the individual who decided to donate their remains to benefit our teaching and learning all of the dissections depicted in the following videos are from individuals who gave their remains to be used in the advancement of medical education and research after death to the yale school of medicine the sequence of videos is divided into classic anatomic sections each video has a set of learning objectives and a brief quiz at the end following each section there is another quiz covering the entire section in order for you to test your knowledge we hope these videos will help you better understand the human form, make time that you may have in the laboratory more worthwhile if you have that opportunity and help you develop an appreciation of the wonderful intricacies of people

311,413,"Programming Languages, Part A","this course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming the course uses the languages ml, racket, and ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language fits together to make you more effective programming in any language and in learning new ones this course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs by using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language the emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it the course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module the course is divided into three coursera courses part a, part b, and part c as explained in more detail in the first module of part a, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing the three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of part c the three parts are not quite equal in length part a is almost as substantial as part b and part c combined week of part a has a more detailed list of topics

316,418,Introduction to Statistics Data Analysis in Public Health,"to introduction to statistics data analysis in public health this course will teach you the core building blocks of statistical analysis types of variables, common distributions, hypothesis testing but, more than that, it will enable you to take a data set you ve never seen before, describe its keys features, get to know its strengths and quirks, run some vital basic analyses and then formulate and test hypotheses based on means and proportions you ll then have a solid grounding to move on to more sophisticated analysis and take the other courses in the series you ll learn the popular, flexible and completely free software r, used by statistics and machine learning practitioners everywhere it s hands on, so you ll first learn about how to phrase a testable hypothesis via examples of medical research as reported by the media then you ll work through a data set on fruit and vegetable eating habits data that are realistically messy, because that s what public health data sets are like in reality there will be mini quizzes with feedback along the way to check your understanding the course will sharpen your ability to think critically and not take things for granted in this age of uncontrolled algorithms and fake news, these skills are more important than ever prerequisites some formulae are given to aid understanding, but this is not one of those courses where you need a mathematics degree to follow it you will need only basic eracy for example, we will not use calculus and familiarity with graphical

321,429,Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression,"while the human genome sequence has transformed our understanding of human biology, it isn t just the sequence of your dna that matters, but also how you use it how are some genes activated and others are silenced how is this controlled the answer is epigenetics epigenetics has been a hot topic for research over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control contributes to disease particularly to cancer epigenetic alterations are heritable through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to mutations in terms of their stability importantly, unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be manipulated therapeutically it has also become clear in recent years that epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment for example diet , which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research this course will give an introduction to the fundamentals of epigenetic control we will examine epigenetic phenomena that are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on mammals we will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the environment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease all necessary information will be covered in the lectures, and recommended

western tradition in the thinkers of ancient greece we begin with the presocratic natural philosophers who were active in ionia in the century bce and are also credited with being the first scientists thales, anaximander, and anaximines made bold proposals about the ultimate constituents of reality, while heraclitus insisted that there is an underlying order to the changing world parmenides of elea formulated a powerful objection to all these proposals, while later greek theorists such as anaxagoras and the atomist democritus attempted to answer that objection in fifth century athens, socrates insisted on the importance of the fundamental ethical question how shall i live and his pupil, plato, and plato s pupil, aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness after the death of aristotle, in the hellenistic period, epicureans and stoics developed and transformed that earlier tradition we will study the major

innovation or social entrepreneurship, working for an organization that wants to increase its social impact, or just starting out, this course will take you on a journey of exploring the complex problems that surround us and how to start thinking about solutions we will debunk common assumptions around what resources are needed to begin acting as a social innovator we will learn from the erous examples of social innovations happening all over the world you will be challenged to get out of your comfort zone and start engaging with the diverse spaces around you by the end of the course, you will have formed your own approach to social innovation, and you will have begun to develop the concepts, mindset, skills, and relationships that will enable you to start and evolve as a changemaker you will be able to purchase a verified certificate if you wish to show evidence of your achievements, but this is optional, and you may apply for financial aid if you are unable to pay the certificate fee the bertha centre for social innovation and entrepreneurship co created this course with rlabs, a social movement born and bred in bridgetown, cape town that is now active in countries the movement empowers youth through innovative and disruptive technology by teaching them vital skills and providing much needed support and a sense of community advocating and supporting initiatives such as rlabs forms part of the bertha centre s mandate the centre is a specialised unit at university of cape town s graduate school of business, and is the first academic centre in africa dedicated to advancing social innovation and entrepreneurship you can view the course trailer at www youtube com/watch v tc wyg wo tweet about this course using the hashtag socinn mooc what s

and what s right through developing a strength based mindset and an appreciative approach you can discover hidden or underused resources these resources might be people, kinds of knowledge and expertise, time, and physical spaces as soon as you start seeing resources all around you, not only can you move forward but you become energised and hopeful, and creative things start to happen you

normally do not engage with understanding how we define differences using cultural, sociological, psychological and spiritual lenses and what the nature of the differences is helps to develop tools for getting out of your comfort zone it takes a little bit of courage because it makes you uncomfortable, but that s how you build the competencies, the personal resilience to engage with difference

take yourself into spaces and you surround yourself with people that you normally do not engage with understanding how we define differences using cultural, sociological, psychological and spiritual lenses and what the nature of the differences is helps to develop tools for getting out of your comfort zone it takes a little bit of courage because it makes you uncomfortable, but that s how you

society, everyone should be allowed to participate on an equal footing no one should be excluded equally, human rights should be enjoyed by all people and discrimination is prohibited yet, even in an open society, universality of human rights and the prohibition of discrimination may raise many questions for example, what about the rights of people who are not yet citizens of that society, such as asylum seekers on the one hand, asylum seekers find themselves in the extremely difficult and vulnerable position of being in transit for that reason, their needs deserve extra consideration for example, they may need special protection against hostile responses by the local population, they may need food, education and housing, and they must be protected against discrimination on the other

344,453,Introduction to Neuroeconomics How the Brain Makes Decisions,"economics, psychology, and neuroscience are converging today into a unified discipline of neuroeconomics with the ultimate aim of creating a single, general theory of human decision making neuroeconomics provides biologists, economists, psychologists and social scientists with a deeper understanding of how they make their own decisions and how others decide neuroscience, when allied with psychology and economics, creates powerful new models to explain why we make decisions neurobiological mechanisms of decision making, decisions under risk, trust and cooperation will be central issues in this course you will be provided with the most recent evidence from brain imaging techniques f mri, tms, etc and introduced to the explanatory models behind them the course does not require any prior study of economics and neuroscience however, it might require you to study novel interdisciplinary materials the course provides an introduction to the methodology, assumptions, and main findings of neuroeconomics our students have different backgrounds therefore, i have adapted and simplified the course to allow all students to understand the interdisciplinary content this course will help you to start your progress in the field of neuroeconomics and to further develop your skills during other more advanced courses and trainings in the future for some topics, the course will also provide supplementary videos to reveal the opinions of leading experts in the field each module provides optional reading material the course structure is as follows during each video, you will have to answer some relevant questions your answers will not affect your final grade at the end of each module, you must complete a quiz

350,463,Building Modern Python Applications on AWS,"in modern cloud native application development, it s oftentimes the goal to build out serverless architectures that are scalable, are highly available, and are fully managed this means less operational overhead for you and your business, and more focusing on the applications and business specific projects that differentiate you in your marketplace in this course, we will be covering how to build a modern, greenfield serverless backend on aws building brand new applications on aws is a different task than lifting and shifting existing applications into aws when you have an existing application that you need to move to aws, you might first look to using amazon ec as your virtual machines, or maybe you might look into using docker containers and container hosting services like amazon elastic container service or amazon elastic kubernetes service those are all great application hosting options, but in most cases, they still require you to have some kind of pulse on the underlying infrastructure hosting your application building modern python applications on aws will explore how to build an api driven application using amazon api gateway for serverless api hosting, aws lambda for serverless computing, and amazon cognito for serverless authentication we will follow an api driven development process and first mock up what the api will look like we will cover all the ins and outs of the service amazon api gateway, and as you ll learn it does a lot more than just hosting an api then we will add authentication to the api using amazon cognito you ll learn about how the authorization flow works with cognito, and how to build it into your apis from there, we will add a lambda backend that will be triggered by api gateway the lambda functions will be using the aws sdks to perform various data processing tasks you ll learn about the different configurations that exist for lambda, and we will show you how to create and manage lambda functions some of the features of our api will require multiple lambda functions to execute in a specific order, like a workflow, and we will use aws step functions to create a serverless workflow finally, we will talk about how to optimize your apis at every layer using aws features note there are four versions of this class, building modern node js applications on aws for node js developers, building modern java applications on aws for java developers, building modern net applications on aws for net developers, and this course, building modern python applications on aws for python developers the courses do for a large part, overlap and in general, we recommend that you take the course that focuses on the sdk you plan to use to develop your aws cloud based applications we expect that you have basic knowledge of aws already some examples of concepts you should be familiar with are you should know the basics of the aws global infrastructure, like what regions and availability zones are you also should know the at a high level aws identity and access management, or iam, and how it is used to control access to aws resources

436,550,Challenging Forensic Science How Science Should Speak to Court,"the aim of this course is to promote critical thinking with regard to forensic science today, in general, most people are dazzled by the technical possibilities offered by forensic science they somewhat live in the illusion that forensic evidence is fool proof and brings factual findings with certainty this course given by specialists in the field goes beyond the conventional image that is promoted through tv series such as csi it alerts without alarming the public on the limits of the techniques in order to promote a sound administration of forensic science in the criminal justice system it allows participants to understand the importance of probabilistic reasoning in forensic science, because uncertainty is a constitutive part of forensic science the course is constructed as a series of causes c l bres that could or have led to miscarriages of justice some of these cases have been part of case reviews carried out at the school of criminal justice of the university of lausanne week what is the dna of a good forensic report this first week will set the scene for the course you will meet the instructors learn about their background, teaching, research and casework activities the school of criminal justice university of lausanne will be shortly presented through a virtual visit, followed by the course objectives the recent enfsi guideline for evaluative reporting, used throughout the course, will be presented enfsi stands for the set of the good principles for writing forensic reports to be used in a court of law the whole course aims at contrasting the practice as observed in notorious cases with the good practice promoted by the enfsi guideline hence, we will start by setting out some reporting criteria that are essential to bring reliable evidence in court and explain the principles of interpretation based on the concept of likelihood ratio that should govern the production of any forensic evidence the application of these principles leads to a defined way whereby the forensic scientist is entitled to speak to court hours to complete hours to complete reading videos

see if the principles advocated allow avoiding misleading evidence we will compare the situations where large quantities of blood are found to cases where low template dna is recovered you will learn to contrast these two situations and discover what type of results can be expected and what methods allow a balanced and robust interpretation this first part of the course will demonstrate that very sensitive techniques require robust interpretation methods in the second part of the course, you will understand that with trace quantities, stringent control procedures are needed on the crime scene and in the laboratory indeed, pollution or so called contamination is an aspect one needs to take into account cases for example in australia, the usa and england have shown that the traces from the crime scene can be polluted at the hospital, by paramedics or in the laboratory it is thus essential to consider this possibility, especially when dna is the central and only element supporting the

448,564,Osteoarchaeology The Truth in Our Bones,"this course is about what we can learn from examining the human skeleton, and how we can use this knowledge to reconstruct the lives of people who lived in the past in archaeology and anthropology, human skeletal remains can provide unique insights into the past and the present insights that cannot be gained otherwise these insights are explored in five main themes spread out over five weeks of learning first, it is shown how age at death, sex and stature can be estimated by the close examination of archaeological skeletal remains in subsequent modules it is shown how human bones can provide information about the diseases and injuries that people suffered from and what they ate also, it is shown how the human skeleton provides information about the kinds of activities that people engaged in and about how they migrated and moved around their landscapes in this course, you will examine all aspects of the human skeleton that can provide us with information about these different facets of life together we will explore the scientific field that is known as human osteoarchaeology human, because it is about us and our ancestors, osteo, because it is about our bones, archaeology, because we use this information to better understand the behaviors and events experienced by past people during the course, you will decipher the clues left behind in the skeletons of past peoples with the methods and techniques that are presented you may also discover some clues hidden in your own skeleton and what they reveal

449,565,Mathematics for Machine Learning PCA,"this intermediate level course introduces the mathematical foundations to derive principal component analysis pca , a fundamental dimensionality reduction technique we ll cover some basic statistics of data sets, such as mean values and variances, we ll compute distances and angles between vectors using inner products and derive orthogonal projections of data onto lower dimensional subspaces using all these tools, we ll then derive pca as a method that minimizes the average squared reconstruction error between data points and their reconstruction at the end of this course, you ll be familiar with important mathematical concepts and you can implement pca all by yourself if you re struggling, you ll find a set of jupyter notebooks that will allow you to explore properties of the techniques and walk you through what you need to do to get on track if you are already an expert, this course may refresh some of your knowledge the lectures, examples and exercises require some ability of abstract thinking good background in linear algebra e g , matrix and vector algebra, linear independence, basis basic background in multivariate calculus e g , partial derivatives, basic optimization basic knowledge in python programming and py disclaimer this course is substantially more abstract and requires more programming than the other two courses of the specialization however, this type of abstract thinking, algebraic manipulation and programming is necessary if you want to understand and develop machine learning algorithms

in this course, you will learn about crop production from professor ken e giller week introduction this first week we are setting the scene for the global food situation today and projected demand and supply options tomorrow covering the four pillars of global food systems, we will zoom in on availability issues, and more in particular on crop production, as central theme of this course photosynthesis plays a key role in this process, turning solar light into food, which fuels mankind analogously to physical principles applied in building houses, you ll be acquainted to the bio physical principles in growing crops week potential production potential production is the simplest representation of crop growth, defined by the crop s genetic potential and the ambient growth factors radiation, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration in the air under perfect crop management, with no limitation of water and nutrients, and a weed, pathogen and pest free environment, crops reach their potential production this week focuses on the conversion of carbon dioxide into plant biomass as powered by solar radiation, with temperature as modifying factor based on variation in solar radiation and temperature around the globe, you ll be able to calculate potential crop yields for different locations week water limited production in the process of fixing carbon dioxide from the air into biomass, crops inevitably lose water by transpiration when transpired water from the leaf surface is not adequately replenished through water uptake by the roots, crop production becomes water limited, resulting in lower yields accounting for the evaporative demand of the air and water availability to the crop, water limited production can be assessed conversely, to reach potential yield, you may determine the amount of water required through irrigation, as a yield increasing measure week nutrient limited production in addition to water, nutrients are essential to crop production to support physiological processes, like photosynthesis various nutrients are absorbed from the soil by the roots when nutrient availability falls short, production becomes nutrient limited in that situation nutrient application by manure or artificial fertilizers is a yield increasing measure week actual production actual crop production refers a situation where production is further reduced by effects of weed, pests insects, mites, nematodes, rodents, and birds , diseases fungi, bacteria, viruses and/or pollutants this introduces an extra level of complexity in plant production in spite of intensive crop protection measures in some parts of the world, the actual production is the common production situation for the majority of the world s agricultural production systems we will look at how weeds, and pests and diseases affect crop yields and what measures can be taken to prevent losses week synthesis having tackled the three distinguished production situations separately in the previous weeks, we now come back to complete the diagram reflecting the principles of production ecology hopefully, it means more to you now and you can use it in analysing the impact of genetics, environment and management on crop yields, as will be discussed in this synopsis"

you are curious to learn more nano and nano technology are the terms we are hearing more and more frequently as time goes one day we see two buckets full of mud are thrown onto two guys while one of them wearing ever clean nano based shirt what happens then is a funny scene but also quite impressive and inspiring, in which how technology of nano s would lead to dreamy inventions the other day, scientist report they have developed new organisms which can take carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the atmosphere and use it to produce plastics and fuels wow, is it real the list of breakthrough inventions and extraordinary solutions could continue for thousands of pages and surprisingly it sounds nanotechnology to have a finger in every pie, from energy harvesting and environmental issues to nano medicine and biology, and almost all branches of engineering, and many more even two nobel prizes have been allocated to nano scale breakthroughs in recent years physics nobel prize of num for invention of graphene and nobel prize in chemistry num for production of molecular machines and robots but, how is it even possible what makes nanotechnology so enabling that even socks company boast to implement it in their products and some others make science fiction stories out of it like building earth to sky elevator by mean of carbon nanotubes i bet, you ve got passionate to start

1208,1512,"Biology, Nanochemistry and Drug Discovery The Hidden Holism","background of the course systems biology is extremely much an interdisciplinary domain of research, demanding the technology schemes and survey experience of humans from a series of scientific survey niche medicinal chemists get ready and/or choose suitable compounds for biological estimate that, if instituted to be active, could render as lead compounds then, they estimate the structure activity relationships of comparable compounds with consideration to their in vivo and in vitro safety and efficacy the nanotechnology society started to assess the impacts of exposition to nanomaterials in the coming early num s the biological action of nanomaterials relies on inherent physicochemical merits not routinely recognized in toxicity researches medication discovery symbolizes the initial move in the creation of modern medications, and takes position in biotech companies, academic institutions, and big pharmaceutical corporations drug invention has modified over the years, but anyway the target continues the same to discover safer drugs for the deadliest ailments restoring responsibility and power to patients and promoting them to practice self care is another side of holistic patronage which drives to therapeutic consultation, self esteem, hope, personal growth, vitality, dignity, self regulation, self sufficiency, and vigor the aim of this course there is an increasing body of literature portraying the merits of marketed drugs, the expansion of chemical space, and the notion of drug likeness in that situation, e erative combinatorics with plain atomic components may become helpful in the design and conception of structurally narration compounds for promoting and expanding libraries of high throughput screening however, by searching more concerning the hidden holism in this course, students can accomplish perception of holism theory and its connection to practice, systems biology tactics to research, nano technology research and improvement, developmental biology and nano chemistry as an interdisciplinary scope, realizing variables of interest in nano chemistry and drug discovery, and the fruitful evolution of holism theory via biology nano chemistry drug discovery approach significance of the course improvements in biological sciences through the previous several decades have guided to the production of a great amount of omics molecular datum at the standard of genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and proteome while recognizing whole the proteins and genes supplies a catalog of person molecular ingredients, it is not enough by itself to comprehend the complication inherent in biological frameworks past observational survey emphasizes erous variation in fundamental care exercise while difference is occasionally seen as problematic, its existence may also be very informative in uncovering tracks to support health patronage delivery when it explains unique acclimations to the requirements and values of commune within the exercise and interactions with the domestic society and health care framework we depict a theoretical scene for usage in improving interventions to develop care that admits the uniqueness of essential care exercises and promotes flexibility in the shape of intervention application, while preserving fidelity to its primary roles method holism is containing the whole being, soul, mind, and body, admitting that the entirety is more than a total of the pieces anyway, the notion of holism was dissected with respect to the methodology by walker and avant to instruct nursing exercise to present more comprehensive patronage to patients and thus far, we confirm the demand for an increased awareness of the essential bidirectional impact of medications and biomechanics in whole living frameworks discussion restoring responsibility and power to patients and promoting them to practice self care is another side of holistic patronage which drives to therapeutic consultation, self esteem, hope, personal growth, vitality, dignity, self regulation, self sufficiency, and vigor in biological webs, molecular ingredients can be genes, drugs, proteins, metabolites, or even ailments and phenotypes interactions can become metabolic coupling, immediate physical interactions, and transcriptional activation anyway, nanomaterials can have distinguished health impacts matched with bulk substances of the similar chemical structure results and conclusion however, life scientists are extremely conscious of the technologies that manufacture great data sets, but the constant growing in computational power is actually of similar significance in helping inventions at a systems standard in perception the reciprocal action of environmental factors with biological frameworks, and how those reciprocal actions may manufacture adverse outcomes developed nano technology and information technology are the scopes that are presently recognized as newer technologies in concentrated survey and targeted treatment as a resolution for several regions of healthcare administration future work and recommendation the truth that a plurality of students can arise from a common chemistry course without a harmonious perception that intermolecular forces work between molecules is extremely doubtful intermolecular forces interpose much of chemistry, beginning from the heat at which phase alterations happen, to reactivity and solubility the discovers and inventors are the central possessors of technical know how and the originative inwardness, the intellectual operators of the investigation and its possible applications, should be extremely implicated in the procedure, not excluded to the sidelines key words biology,

1233,1539,Fundamentals of Electrical Controls,"this course is an introduction to electrical controls with an emphasis on motor controls in the real world in this course, we focus on industrial and commercial installations, we will start with the absolute basics of electrical circuits we look at the fundamentals of resistive circuits, and introduce ohms law, a mathematical formula that all electricians learn the course looks at the different types of voltages and where they come from in the real world, focussing on transformer formations from the power supply authority, and ac and dc voltages as this is a course on the fundamentals of electrical controls, we will go through the basics of control circuits such as, normally open and normally closed, and look at how controls are made up of series and parallel circuits taking a more practical approach to the subject, we dive inside control panels and look at each electrical component that we will be using later in the course, in our own motor control installation we look inside the parts in detail and see how they work, discuss ratings, and learn how to size them up, with a particular focus on contactors and overloads we also simplify an explanation of how an asynchronous motor works before we get to wiring up our own control circuit, we look at the different types of control voltages in the real world and follow them from end device at the customers installation all the way back to the supply transformer at the power company, so we can see how a full installation might look, and get an insight into different systems that we might find in industry after learning the basics, we look at how we would install a motor control installation from scratch, including the motor itself we get to see all the parts that we have learned about, working together in a mock real world installation, we learn how to size up the components and then go through the wiring of the circuit step by step part of installing a control board is commissioning it, so we go through the operation of the circuit after we have installed it to make sure it works installations are often amended and modified in the real world, so we ll look at a few ways in which we could modify our mock installation, change our wiring around and re commission the installation at the end of the course, we re going to challenge ourselves, and learn how to fault find a circuit as we would if we were called to a breakdown as an electrical controls technician we ll go through a few faults that we might come up against in the industry and look at how we might repair them we also briefly touch on preventative maintenance techniques and discuss why they are important, for safety reasons and also financial reasons too controls can be quite daunting and complicated, we will go through slowly and steadily, learning each part of the installation in detail before putting it all together, the course is weighted towards learning from practical examples, perfect for those of us that are visual learners and, instead of enforcing hard and fast rules of how things must be done, we focus more on learning how to break down circuits and understand them for ourselves i will show you wiring techniques used by controls electricians in the real world what is covered in the course learn the fundamentals ac and dc voltages, num phase voltages, resistive circuits, ohms law, normally open and normally closed, series and parallel circuits, supply transformers star delta , faults to earth electrical components control panels, isolating switches, circuit

1263,1569,Gas Insulated Substation GIS Electrical Power System,"gas insulated substations a gas insulated substation gis is a high voltage substation in which the major structures are contained in a sealed environment with sulfur hexafluoride gas as the insulating medium gis technology originated in japan, where there was a substantial need to develop technology to make substations as compact as possible the clearance required for phase to phase and phase to ground for all equipment is much lower than that required in an air insulated substation the total space required for a gis is num of that needed for a conventional substation gas insulated substations offer other advantages in addition to the reduced space requirements because the substation is enclosed in a building, a gis is less sensitive to pollution, as well as salt, sand or large amounts of snow although the initial cost of building a gis is higher than building an air insulated substation, the operation and maintenance costs of a gis are less the primary applications for gas insulated substations include high voltage installations the higher the voltage, the more favorable gas insulated technology becomes the footprint of num k v conventional substation is enormous, and gis technology allows a significant size reduction urban installations gis technology can be used for installations in areas where the cost of real estate or aesthetic appeal is a significant consideration indoor installations building an air insulated substation indoors is usually impractical, but a gis can easily go inside buildings environmentally sensitive installations gis technology is popular in desert and arctic areas because it can be enclosed in a building with environmental control gas insulated substations also contain the electrical components within a faraday cage and are therefore totally shielded from lightning beta has completed several noteworthy gis projects in recent years the glendale substation was unique in both its architectural design and engineering challenges incorporating an aesthetically pleasing substation into the los angeles area beta was also involved in the design and construction of a gis substation in anaheim, california that is completely hidden by a park course content num sections num lectures num h num m total length expand all sections introduction num lectures num hr num min introduction preview num num hv gis surge arrestor and gas compartments preview num num gis maintenance tools num num gis factory acceptance test num num how gis is shown on single line num num partial discharge monitoring in gis num num d view of gis explained num num gis t num num k v alstom num num last words num lecture num min bonus lecture num num gas insulated substations gis deep dive"

resistance ir test measures the total resistance between any two points separated by electrical insulation the test, therefore, determines how effective the dielectric insulation is in resisting the flow of electrical current insulation resistance / megger test most commonly referred to as simply a megger, the insulation resistance test set or megohmeter is used to determine the condition of insulation on various types of electrical equipment like cables, transformers and switchgear tests are typically conducted by applying a direct current dc voltage to the conductor under test and measuring the current that flows through insulation called the leakage current and into the non current carrying metal parts of equipment contaminated insulation can be determined by observing the absorption current or current absorbed by the insulation over a specified period of time what causes insulation to degrade electrical stress mechanical stress chemical attack thermal stress environmental contamination how an insulation resistance tester operates the megger insulation tester is essentially a high range resistance meter ohmmeter with a built in dc generator the instrument s generator, which can be hand cranked, battery or line operated, develops a high dc voltage that causes several small currents through and over surfaces of the insulation being tested the total current is measured by the ohmmeter, which has an analog indicating scale, digital readout or both insulation resistance / megger test record keeping insulation resistance test data may be used to establish a trending pattern with deviations from the baseline information permit evaluation of insulation the results of these tests typically expressed in megohms are dependent on the temperature of the insulating material and the humidity of the surrounding environment at the time of testing therefore all readings must be corrected to a base temperature, such as num c how much voltage can a be produced insulation testers come in a variety of sizes and output voltages depending on its specific application a handheld num v megohmeter is usually sufficient for num v class equipment while larger sets for use on high voltage apparatus can output up to num , num v or more megger test connections there are three test terminals on an insulation resistance tester marked positive , negative and guard g most basic measurements utilize only the positive and negative terminals, such as in cases when there is little possibility of adverse current paths that could affect the result when testing at higher voltages, such as with cable or transformers, the guard terminal can be used to divert surface leakage from the measuring circuit not all insulation testers are equipped with a guard terminal note handheld megohmeters with outputs of num v or less may not be equipped with a guard terminal what is insulation resistance no insulation is ideal and hence there will be always some leakage current from insulation to ground, when voltage is applied leakage current direction how to measure insulation resistance insulation resistance is measured by ohm s law insulation resistance applied voltage / leakage current applied voltage num vmeasure leakage current num num amp measured insurance resistance num mega ohms understanding insulation resistance equivalent circuitfinding insulation resistance value by using formula leakage current types there are two types of leakage current num conductive leakage current num capacitive charging leakage current num polarizing / absorption current num surface leakage current different types of leakage currents its effect on readings the total current is the sum of these components leakage current is shown as one current it is this current that can be measured directly by a microammeter or, in terms of megohms, at a particular voltage by means of a megger insulation tester some instruments offer the alternatives of displaying a measurement in terms of current or as a resistance because the total current depends upon the time that the voltage is applied, ohm s law r e/i only holds, theoretically, at an infinite time that implies waiting forever before taking a reading it is also highly dependent upon starting from a base level of total discharge the first step in any insulation test is, therefore, to ensure that the insulation is completely discharged conduction current conduction current is steady through the insulation and is usually represented by a very high value resistor in parallel with the capacitance of the insulation it is a component of the leakage current, which is the current that would be measured when the insulation is fully charged and full absorption has taken place note that it includes surface leakage, which can be reduced or eliminated by the use of the guard terminal to be discussed later the graph in figure num shows the nature of each of the components of current with respect to time surface leakage current the surface leakage current is present because the surface of the insulation is contaminated with moisture or salts the current is constant with time and depends on the degree of ionization present, which is itself dependent on temperature it is often ignored as a separate current, being included with the conduction current below as the total leakage current capacitive charging leakage current ic when two or more conductors are run together in a raceway, they act as a capacitor due to this capacitive effect, a leakage current flows through conductor insulation this current lasts only for a few seconds as the dc voltage is applied and drops out after the insulation has been charged to its full test voltage in low capacitance equipment, the capacitive current is higher than conductive leakage current, but usually disappears by the time we start recording the data because of this, it is important to let the reading settle out before recording it on the other hand, when testing high capacitance equipment the capacitive charging leakage current can last for a very long time before settling out polarization / absorption leakage current ia absorption current is caused by the polarization of molecules within dielectric material the positive and negative charges in molecules separate, causing an increase in the state of polarization p a changing state of polarization corresponds to charge movement and so is equivalent to a current, hence the term polarization current absorption current is actually made up of up to three components, which decay at a decreasing rate to a value close to zero over a period of several minutes the first is caused by a general drift of free electrons through the insulation under the effect of the electric field components of test currents capacitor charging behavior capacitance of cable is distributed along cable capacitance is added in parallel hence it will be added longer is the cable more will be the capacitance capacitance equivalent circuit of three phase circuit capacitor charging time charging time charging current will decay when capacitor is charged after cable / equipment is charged capacitive charging current reduces to zero time constant t rc capacitor charge in num teffect of charging current on reading of insulation resistance insulation resistance can be defined as ir v applied / i conductive resistive leakage current but in practical there is capacitive leakage current is also available due to capacitance of cable tester read ir v / i r i c i c decays to zero after num t and reading become stable initially tester will show low reading and with time it will increase become stable testing of ir during the testing procedure, the high dc voltage generated by pressing the test button will cause a small micro amps current flow through the conductor and the insulation the amount of current depends on the amount of voltage applied, the system s capacitance, the total resistance, and the temperature of the material for a fixed voltage, the higher the current, the lower the resistance e ir, r e/i the total resistance is the sum of the internal resistance of the conductor small value plus the insulation resistance in m s dielectric polarization dielectric polarization is the term given to describe the behavior of a material when an external electric field is applied on it a simple picture can be made using a capacitor as an example the charges in the material will have a response to the electric field caused by the plates absorption current absorption current is actually made up of up to three components, which decay at a decreasing rate to a value close to zero over a period of several minutes the first is caused by a general drift of free electrons through the insulation under the effect of the electric field a guide to diagnostic insulation testing above num kv num the second is caused by molecular distortion whereby the imposed electric field distorts the negative charge of the electron shells circulating around the nucleus toward the positive voltage the third is due to the alignment of polarized molecules within the electric field applied this alignment is fairly random in a neutral state, but when an electric field is applied, these polarized molecules line up with the field to a greater or lesser extent polarization how much voltages should be applied for different insulations application of ir test installation test the most important reason for testing insulation is to insure public and personal safety by performing a high dc voltage test between de energized current carrying hot , grounded, and grounding conductors, you can eliminate the possibility of having a life threatening short circuit or short to ground maintenance test the second most important rea son for insulation testing is to protect and prolong the life of electrical systems and motors over the years, electrical systems are exposed to environmental factors such as dirt, grease, temperature, stress, and vibration these conditions can lead to insulation failure, resulting in loss of production or even fires periodic maintenance tests can provide valuable information about the state of deterioration and will help in predicting possible failure of the system installation test / proof testing to check healthiness of installed equipment / cables the proof test is a simple, quick test used to indicate the instantaneous condition of insulation it provides no diagnostic data and the test voltages used are much higher than the voltages used in predictive maintenance tests the proof test is sometimes called go/no go test because it tests cable systems for maintenance errors, incorrect installation, serious degradation, or contamination the installation is declared acceptable if no breakdown occurs during testing choosing the test voltage choosing the test voltage proof test procedure proof testing
